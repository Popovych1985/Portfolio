		<h2>Bio</h2>
		<p>
		Sergii Popovych. A UX & product designer. I am based in Los Angeles. However, I design for clients globally.
		I bring a uniquely diverse perspective driven by seven years of experience designing across industries and platforms. I have led both design and development efforts for scores of products with clients ranging from under-funded start-ups to fortune 500 clients around the world.

		I work with clients of all scope and sizes seeking front-end design services across the web, mobile, console, and TV.

		I always focus my work to achieve a balance between usability, content and visuals. I make it a priority when a mandated by the client to work very closely with front-end developers and deliver a product that precisely matches the final design, specifications, and requirements of product owners.
